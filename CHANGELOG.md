## [Unreleased]

## [26.05.1] - 2026-05-09
### Added
- **Neural Distillation Engine:** New memory compression logic that consolidates fragmented `.md` memories into structured, topical knowledge bases.
- **Memory Distiller Script:** `scripts/memory_distiller.py` utilizing the LOGIC tier (DeepSeek-R1) for high-density distillation.
- **Agentic Distillation:** New `distill` tool for Aether-Agent to autonomously manage long-term memory.

### Changed
- **AetherVault Upgrade:** Increased memory priority and token budget in `knowledge_loader.py`.
- **UI Improvements:** Added 'DISTILL' to the TOOLS menu in `aether.sh`.

## [26.04.2] — 2026-04-08
### Phase 3 — Voice I/O, Real Swarm, Version Revision

#### Voice I/O Pipeline
- **Whisper.cpp integration** for speech-to-text (STT)
- **Piper TTS integration** for text-to-speech (TTS)
- Voice mode toggle in aether.sh — hands-free operation
- Audio recording via `termux-microphone-record` or `arecord`
- Voice-triggered session start option

#### Real Swarm Orchestrator
- **Actual multi-agent pipeline**: LOGIC plans → CODE implements → AGENT executes
- Each tier invokes real `llama-cli` with structured prompts
- Output passed between stages via temp files
- Progress tracking with stage-by-stage status
- Error recovery: if a stage fails, the swarm retries with adjusted prompts

#### Version System Revision
- **Dropped arbitrary V20.0** → adopting CalVer `YY.MM.patch`
- **VERSION file** added at project root
- **Per-version documentation** in `VERSIONS.md` — detailed changelog
  with what was done, why, and by whom for every release
- Version displayed in aether.sh boot, agent prompt, and README
- Current: `26.04.2` (April 2026, patch 2)

#### Readme & Navigation
- README restructured with clear sections, version badge, quick-start
- Removed marketing fluff, added practical "what this does" overview
- Added `VERSIONS.md` link prominently in README

## [26.04.1] — 2026-04-08
### Phase 2 — Settings Hub, LSP, Context Import, Token Optimization

#### New Systems
- **Settings Hub** (`settings/settings.sh`): Central gum-based TUI for
  config management, profiles (performance/reasoning/coding/conservative/
  balanced), feature toggles, import/export, plugin manager, custom commands
- **LSP Server** (`lsp/lsp_server.sh`): Language Server Protocol bridge
  with diagnostics, symbol extraction, go-to-definition, hover info,
  JSON-RPC server mode. Supports Python, JS/TS, Shell, Rust, Go, C/C++
- **Context Import** (`contexts/context_manager.sh`): Gemini-style context
  import from files, URLs, clipboard, directories
- **Token Optimizer** (`scripts/token_optimizer.sh`): RTK-inspired token
  compression (60-90% savings), smart language-aware compacting, budget
  analysis, relevance-based loading, AI bloat removal
- **Agentic Workflows** (`workflows/registry/workflows.yaml`): YAML-
  declarative multi-agent orchestration (ThibautMelen nika pattern).
  6 workflow templates, 5 verbs: DEFINE, ROUTE, EXECUTE, EVALUATE, COMPOSE
- **Optional Extras Installer** (`scripts/extras_installer.sh`): Modular
  feature selection during install, enableable later. 17 extras across
  5 categories
- **Testing Framework**: Automated test suite for all components

#### Enhancements
- Skills system fixed: SKILL.md content now fully loaded into agent prompt
- Agent reads settings config, injects profile/parameters
- aether.sh reads config.json for threads, context, temperature, colors
- install.sh rewritten with modular extras selection
- Toolbox expanded to 17 tools
